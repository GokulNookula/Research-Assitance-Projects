Code mainly based on Parsing huge files.

This code is mainly used to check whether if a location is in california or not. We do this by passing in the lattitude and longitude
and first check if it is inside california or not.
Then we use Geopy to find it's address and the county.
We later put that address back into a csv file where we store all the parsed data.


# Things Needed to Run the above program

Must install geopy library by doing:-  pip install geopy
